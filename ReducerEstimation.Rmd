## Notebook for exploring reduction 

This notebook will explore _estimation_ in for reducer models.  For the setup and population see "ReducerNotes.Rmd".  

# SNoTE
Consider both linear mean and propensity models. Assume that $r(X)$ is also linear in $X$.
$$
\begin{align}
m_0(X) &= \mathbf{\alpha}'X \quad \text{(Expectation of control outcome)}\\
e(X) &= \mathbf{\beta}'X \quad \text{(Propensity score)}\\
d(X) &= \gamma'X \quad \text{(Deconfounding score)}
\end{align}
$$

where $\alpha$ is an $p \times m_\alpha$ matrix and $\beta$ is a $p \times m_\beta$ matrix with $m < p$.  Assume (welog?) that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are semi-orthogonal matrices, e.g. $\alpha^T\alpha = I$.
